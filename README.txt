# Titanic Survival Analysis

## Project Overview
This project explores the Titanic dataset to analyze survival rates among different passenger groups. The objective is to uncover key insights into the factors affecting survival using data visualization and feature engineering.

## Key Findings
- **Survival by Class**: Higher-class passengers had a higher survival rate.
- **Survival by Gender**: Women had a significantly higher survival rate.
- **Age and Survival**: Younger passengers had a slightly better survival rate.
- **Family and Survival**: Passengers with family on board were slightly more likely to survive.
